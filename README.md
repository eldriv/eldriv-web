This repository contains my personal website portfolio, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
make dev
```
> **NOTE:** The `Makefile` has the ability to detect the available package manager.  
> It checks for `bun`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`, and falls back to `npm` if none of the others are found.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
